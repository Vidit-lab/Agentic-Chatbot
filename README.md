## 🌟 Vision & Value Proposition

Most AI chatbot demos are stateless wrappers around a single LLM call. **This project is different.**

`LangGraph Agentic AI Chatbot` is a **graph-native, stateful AI system** that routes user intent across three distinct execution pipelines — a lightweight conversational agent, a ReAct-style tool-using agent with live web search, and a fully autonomous multi-node AI news pipeline that fetches, summarizes, and persists intelligence reports.

Built on LangGraph's first-class `StateGraph` abstraction, the system demonstrates production-grade patterns: conditional edge routing, prebuilt tool nodes, state-passing across agent hops, and a clean separation between graph construction logic and UI.

> **This is not a chatbot. It's a graph-orchestrated agentic runtime with a chatbot interface.**

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🗺️ **Graph-Native Architecture** | Every use case is a compiled `StateGraph` — not a chain, not a simple prompt loop |
| 🔀 **Dynamic Mode Switching** | Three fully independent graph topologies selectable at runtime via Streamlit UI |
| 🛠️ **ReAct Tool Loop** | The tool-use agent autonomously decides when to invoke Tavily web search and loops back until the task is complete |
| 📰 **Autonomous News Pipeline** | A sequential 3-node graph independently fetches AI news, summarizes it with an LLM, and saves the result — zero human in the loop |
| ⚡ **Groq-Accelerated Inference** | Powered by Groq's ultra-low-latency LPU inference for near-instant LLM responses |
| 🧩 **Modular Node Design** | Each node (`BasicChatbotNode`, `ChatbotWithToolNode`, `AINewsNode`) is an isolated, testable Python class |
| 🔌 **Multi-LLM Ready** | Architecture supports both `langchain_groq` and `langchain_openai` — swap models without changing graph logic |
| 🗃️ **FAISS Vector Store Ready** | `faiss-cpu` included for RAG extensions and semantic search augmentation |

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### State Definition

All nodes in this system communicate through a shared `State` object — the single source of truth for the entire graph execution. Built on LangChain's `MessagesState` pattern, it carries the full conversation history as a list of `BaseMessage` objects, enabling every node to read prior context and append new messages atomically.

```python
# src/langgraphAgenticAI/state/state.py
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState

class State(MessagesState):
    # Inherits: messages: Annotated[list[BaseMessage], add_messages]
    # Add custom fields here as the graph grows:
    # summary: str
    # retrieved_docs: list[str]
    pass
```

The `add_messages` reducer ensures messages are **appended**, not overwritten, on each graph step — preserving full multi-turn history across all nodes automatically.

---

### Node Logic

The `GraphBuilder` class acts as the **factory** for all graph topologies. It wires nodes, edges, and conditional routing in three distinct configurations:

#### 1. `basic_chatbot_build_graph()` — Linear Conversation

A minimal two-edge graph. `START → chatbot → END`. The `BasicChatbotNode` processes the current state's messages and returns a new AI message. No tool calls, no loops. Ideal for pure LLM conversation.

#### 2. `chatbot_with_tools_build_graph()` — ReAct Agent Loop

The core agentic pattern. The chatbot node is bound with tools; if the LLM decides a tool call is needed, the prebuilt `tools_condition` router fires, redirecting execution to the `ToolNode`. The tool result is appended to state and control returns to the chatbot — creating a **self-correcting reasoning loop** that terminates only when the LLM returns a final answer.

#### 3. `ai_news_build_graph()` — Autonomous Pipeline

A linear 3-node DAG with no human interaction. The graph autonomously: fetches live AI news → passes results to an LLM summarizer → writes the final report to disk. This pattern demonstrates LangGraph as an **agentic batch processor**, not just a chatbot engine.

### Mode 1: Basic Chatbot

    style B fill:#1d3557,color:#fff,stroke:#457b9d,stroke-width:2px
```

### Mode 2: Chatbot with Tools (ReAct Loop)

```mermaid

    A([▶ START]) --> B

    B[🧠 chatbot\nChatbotWithToolNode\nLLM + bound tools]

    B -->|tools_condition router| D{🔀 Route?}

    D -->|Tool call detected\nin AIMessage| E[🛠️ tools\nToolNode\nTavily Web Search]
    D -->|No tool call\nfinal answer ready| F([⏹ END])

    E -->|Tool result appended\nto State.messages| B

    style A fill:#2d6a4f,color:#fff,stroke:none
    style F fill:#c1121f,color:#fff,stroke:none
    style B fill:#1d3557,color:#fff,stroke:#457b9d,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#023e8a,color:#fff,stroke:#0077b6,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#6a0572,color:#fff,stroke:#9d4edd,stroke-width:2px
```

> **How the router works:** `tools_condition` is a LangGraph prebuilt function. It inspects the last message in `State.messages`. If it's an `AIMessage` with a `tool_calls` attribute populated, it routes to `"tools"`. Otherwise, it routes to `END`. This single conditional edge powers the entire ReAct reasoning cycle.
